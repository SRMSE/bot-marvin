Check ulimit, which is the # of open file allow if you are in LInux system.  Increase ulimit by editing :
	$ vi /etc/security/limits.conf
and put this:
	httpd soft nofile 10240
	httpd hard nofile 10240



You may need to increase the heap and optimize your node server.  see this: http://blog.caustik.com/2012/04/11/escape-the-1-4gb-v8-heap-limit-in-node-js/
	$ sudo node â€“max-old-space-size=1700 myNode.js 

When running your code again, check netstat and count if the socket increase and goes back to default level when server stop sending out requests.

Tip:set the batchSize wisely as it will be the number of concurrent connections
